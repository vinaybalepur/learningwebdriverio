let vs var
1. We cannot declare multiple times the same variable using let. But with var we can do this

let a = 1
let a = 2
The above statement will throw a error variale already declared

var b =1
var b = 2
There will no error

2. Reassigning variable with let is allowed. This also holds true for var

let a = 100
a= 200

3. const is like final of java. This variable value cannot be reassigned or redeclared
